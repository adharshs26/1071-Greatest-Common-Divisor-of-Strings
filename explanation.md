- The gcdOfStrings function identifies the largest common substring that can evenly divide both input strings. 
- It first checks if the strings are identical or if they concatenate in both orders to match each other, ensuring they can be constructed from the same repeating substring. 
- It then uses a helper gcd function to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the lengths of the two strings. 
- This GCD determines the length of the largest possible repeating substring that can divide both strings. 
- Finally, the function extracts and returns this substring from the first string.
